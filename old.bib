ABSTRACT = {We introduce a model of computation based on the use of
write-once memory. Write-once memory has the property that bits may be set 
but not reset. Our model consists of a RAM with a small amount (such as 
logarithmic or n for a<1, where a is th size of the problem) of regular 
memory, and a polynomial amount of write-once memory.  Bounds are given 
on the time required to simulate on write-once memory algorithms which 
originally run on a RAM with a polynomial amount of regular memory. We 
attempt to characterize algorithms that can be simulated on our write-once 
memory model with very little slow-down. A persistent computation is one 
in which at all times, the memory state of the computation at any previous 
point in time can be reconstructed.  We show that any data structure of 
computation implemental on this write-once memory model can be made 
persistent without sacrificing much in the way of running time or space. 
The space requirements of algorithms running on the write-once model 
are studied. We show that ge}

ABSTRACT = {A new two-person pebble game that models parallel
computations is defined. This game extends the two-person pebble game
defined by Dymond and tompa [J. Comput. System Sci. 30 (1985), pp.
149--161] and is used to characterize two natural parallel complexity
classes, namely LOGCFL and AC^1. The characterizations show a
fundamental way in which the computations in these two classes differ.
This game model also unifies the proofs of some well-known results of
complexity theory.  }

                 reachable data and not the memory size. This paper
                 compares the CPU overhead and the memory requirements
                 of the two collection algorithms extended with
                 generations, and finds that mark-and-sweep collection
                 requires at most a small amount of additional CPU
                 overhead (3-6%) but requires an average of 20% (and up
                 to 40%) less memory to achieve the same page fault
                 rate. The comparison is based on results obtained using
