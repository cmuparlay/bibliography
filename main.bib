abstract = {We introduce simple, universal, sound, and complete proof methods for producing machine-verifiable proofs of linearizability and strong linearizability. Universality means that our method works for any object type; soundness means that an algorithm can be proved correct by our method only if it is linearizable (resp. strong linearizable); and completeness means that any linearizable (resp. strong linearizable) implementation can be proved so using our method. We demonstrate the simplicity and power of our method by producing proofs of linearizability for the Herlihy-Wing queue and Jayanti's single-scanner snapshot, as well as a proof of strong linearizability of the Jayanti-Tarjan union-find object. All three of these proofs are machine-verified by TLAPS (the TLA+ Proof System).},

abstract = {We provide a tight analysis that settles the round complexity of the well-studied parallel randomized greedy MIS algorithm, thus answering the main open question of Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA’12].The parallel/distributed randomized greedy Maximal Independent Set (MIS) algorithm works as follows. An order of the vertices is chosen uniformly at random. Then, in each round, all vertices that appear before their neighbors in the order are added to the independent set and removed from the graph along with their neighbors. The main question of interest is the number of rounds it takes until the graph is empty. This algorithm has been studied since 1987, initiated by Coppersmith, Raghavan, and Tompa [FOCS’87], and the previously best known bounds were O(log n) rounds in expectation for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs by Calkin and Frieze [Random Struc. Alg.’90] and O(log2 n) rounds with high probability for general graphs by Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA’12].We prove a high probability upper bound of O(log n) on the round complexity of this algorithm in general graphs and that this bound is tight. This also shows that parallel randomized greedy MIS is as fast as the celebrated algorithm of Luby [STOC’85, JALG’86].},

abstract = {Many dynamic graph algorithms have an amortized update time, rather than a stronger worst-case guarantee. But amortized data structures are not suitable for real-time systems, where each individual operation has to be executed quickly. For this reason, there exist many recent randomized results that aim to provide a guarantee stronger than amortized expected. The strongest possible guarantee for a randomized algorithm is that it is always correct (Las Vegas) and has high-probability worst-case update time, which gives a bound on the time for each individual operation that holds with high probability.In this article, we present the first polylogarithmic high-probability worst-case time bounds for the dynamic spanner and the dynamic maximal matching problem.
(1)For dynamic spanner, the only known o(n) worst-case bounds were O(n3/4) high-probability worst-case update time for maintaining a 3-spanner and O(n5/9) for maintaining a 5-spanner. We give a O(1)k log3 (n) high-probability worst-case time bound for maintaining a (2k-1)-spanner, which yields the first worst-case polylog update time for all constant k. (All the results above maintain the optimal tradeoff of stretch 2k-1 and \~{O}(n1+1/k) edges.)(2)For dynamic maximal matching, or dynamic 2-approximate maximum matching, no algorithm with o(n) worst-case time bound was known and we present an algorithm with O(log 5 (n)) high-probability worst-case time; similar worst-case bounds existed only for maintaining a matching that was (2+ϵ)-approximate, and hence not maximal.Our results are achieved using a new approach for converting amortized guarantees to worst-case ones for randomized data structures by going through a third type of guarantee, which is a middle ground between the two above: An algorithm is said to have worst-case expected update time ɑ if for every update σ, the expected time to process σ is at most ɑ. Although stronger than amortized expected, the worst-case expected guarantee does not resolve the fundamental problem of amortization: A worst-case expected update time of O(1) still allows for the possibility that every 1/f(n) updates requires ϴ (f(n)) time to process, for arbitrarily high f(n). In this article, we present a black-box reduction that converts any data structure with worst-case expected update time into one with a high-probability worst-case update time: The query time remains the same, while the update time increases by a factor of O(log 2(n)).Thus, we achieve our results in two steps: (1) First, we show how to convert existing dynamic graph algorithms with amortized expected polylogarithmic running times into algorithms with worst-case expected polylogarithmic running times. (2) Then, we use our black-box reduction to achieve the polylogarithmic high-probability worst-case time bound. All our algorithms are Las-Vegas-type algorithms.},

Our randomized algorithms’ approximation and worst-case update time bounds both hold w.h.p.&nbsp;against adaptive adversaries.Our algorithms are based on simulating new two-pass streaming matching algorithms in the dynamic setting. Our key new idea is to invoke the recent sublinear-time matching algorithm of Behnezhad (FOCS’21) in a white-box manner to efficiently simulate the second pass of our streaming algorithms, while bypassing the well-known vertex-update barrier.},

Plugging in known dynamic fractional matching algorithms into our framework, we obtain numerous randomized dynamic matching algorithms which work against adaptive adversaries. In contrast, all previous randomized algorithms for this problem assumed a weaker, oblivious, adversary. Our dynamic algorithms against adaptive adversaries include, for any constant є >0, a (2+є)-approximate algorithm with constant update time or polylog worst-case update time, as well as (2−δ)-approximate algorithms in bipartite graphs with arbitrarily-small polynomial update time. All these results achieve polynomially better update time to approximation trade-offs than previously known to be achievable against adaptive adversaries.},

Besides maintaining connectivity information in logarithmic time, they can support aggregation of information over paths, trees, or both. We perform an experimental comparison of several versions of dynamic trees: ST-trees, ET-trees, RC-trees, and two variants of top trees (self-adjusting and worst-case). We quantify their strengths and weaknesses through tests with various workloads, most stemming from practical applications. We observe that a simple, linear-time implementation is remarkably fast for graphs of small diameter, and that worst-case and randomized data structures are best when queries are very frequent. The best overall performance, however, is achieved by self-adjusting ST-trees.},

Given a vertex v and an integer i > 0, find the ith vertex on the path from v to the root. Given any m, 1 ≤ m ≤ log*n, we achieve the following results: (1) O(log(m) n)1 time using an optimal number of processors for preprocessing and constant time using a single processor for processing a query if m is constant. (2) O(log* n) time using an optimal number of processors for preprocessing and O(log* n) time using a single processor for processing a query. These results assume that the Euler tour of the tree and the level (distance from the root) of each vertex are given. Without these assumptions, the only change in result (1) above is that preprocessing time increases to O(log n). An immediate corollary is a serial linear-time bound for preprocessing and a constant-time bound for processing a query.1log(i) denotes the ith iterate of the log function (i.e., log(1) (n) = log n and log(i) (n) = log(log(i−1)(n)) for i ≥ 2). log* n = minimum {i|log(i)(n) ≤ 1}.}

Recently there has been a surge of interest in the online version of matching and its generalizations, due to the important new application domain of Internet advertising. The theory of online matching and allocation has played a critical role in designing algorithms for ad allocation. This monograph surveys the key problems, models and algorithms from online matchings, as well as their implication in the practice of ad allocation. The goal is to provide a classification of the problems in this area, an introduction into the techniques used, a glimpse into the practical impact, and to provide direction in terms of open questions. Matching continues to find core applications in diverse domains, and the advent of massive online and streaming data emphasizes the future applicability of the algorithms and techniques surveyed here.},

abstract = {We present the first formal specification and verification of the fine-grained concurrent multi-producer-multi-consumer queue algorithm from Meta’s C++ library Folly of core infrastructure components. The queue is highly optimized, practical, and used by Meta in production where it scales to thousands of consumer and producer threads. We present an implementation of the algorithm in an ML-like language and formally prove that it is a contextual refinement of a simple coarse-grained queue (a property that implies that the MPMC queue is linearizable). We use the ReLoC relational logic and the Iris program logic to carry out the proof and to mechanize it in the Coq proof assistant. The MPMC queue is implemented using three modules, and our proof is similarly modular. By using ReLoC and Iris’s support for modular reasoning we verify each module in isolation and compose these together. A key challenge of the MPMC queue is that it has a so-called external linearization point, which ReLoC has no support for reasoning about. Thus we extend ReLoC, both on paper and in Coq, with novel support for reasoning about external linearization points.},

abstract = {The Michael-Scott queue (MS-queue) is a concurrent non-blocking queue. In an earlier pen-and-paper proof it was shown that a simplified variant of the MS-queue contextually refines a coarse-grained queue. Here we use the Iris and ReLoC logics to show, for the first time, that the original MS-queue contextually refines a coarse-grained queue. We make crucial use of the recently introduced prophecy variables of Iris and ReLoC. Our proof uses a fairly simple invariant that relies on encoding which nodes in the MS-queue can reach other nodes. To further simplify the proof, we extend separation logic with a generally applicable persistent points-to predicate for representing immutable pointers. This relies on a generalization of the well-known algebra of fractional permissions into one of discardable fractional permissions. We define the persistent points-to predicate entirely inside the base logic of Iris (thus getting soundness “for free”). We use the same approach to prove refinement for a variant of the MS-queue resembling the one used in the java.util.concurrent library. We have mechanized our proofs in Coq using the formalizations of ReLoC and Iris in Coq.},

abstract = {The multicore revolution that took place one decade ago has turned parallel programming into a major concern for the mainstream software development industry. In this context, Transactional Memory (TM) has emerged as a simpler and attractive alternative to that of lock-based synchronization, whose complexity and error-proneness are widely recognized.The notion of permissiveness in TM translates to only aborting a transaction when it cannot be accepted in any history that guarantees a target correctness criterion. This theoretically powerful property is often neglected by state-of-the-art TMs because it imposes considerable algorithmic costs. Instead, these TMs opt to maximize their implementation?s efficiency by aborting transactions under overly conservative conditions. As a result, they risk rejecting a significant number of safe executions.In this article, we seek to identify a sweet spot between permissiveness and efficiency by introducing the Time-Warp Multiversion (TWM) algorithm. TWM is based on the key idea of allowing an update transaction that has performed stale reads (i.e., missed the writes of concurrently committed transactions) to be serialized by ?committing it in the past,? which we call a time-warp commit. At its core, TWM uses a novel, lightweight validation mechanism with little computational overhead. TWM also guarantees that read-only transactions can never be aborted. Further, TWM guarantees Virtual World Consistency, a safety property that is deemed as particularly relevant in the context of TM.We demonstrate the practicality of this approach through an extensive experimental study: we compare TWM with five other TMs, representative of typical alternative design choices, and on a wide variety of benchmarks. This study shows an average performance improvement across all considered workloads and TMs of 65% in high concurrency scenarios, with gains extending up to 9 \texttimes{} with the most favorable benchmarks. These results are a consequence of TWM?s ability to achieve drastic reduction of aborts in scenarios of nonminimal contention, while introducing little overhead (approximately 10%) in worst-case, synthetically designed scenarios (i.e., no contention or contention patterns that cannot be optimized using TWM).},

The key to achieving this is treating scans as first class citizens and organizing the data structure around them. KiWi provides wait-free scans, whereas its put operations are lightweight and lock-free. It optimizes memory management jointly with data structure access. We implement KiWi and compare it to state-of-the-art solutions. Compared to other KV-maps providing atomic scans, KiWi performs either long scans or concurrent puts an order of magnitude faster. Its scans are twice as fast as non-atomic ones implemented via iterators in the Java skiplist.},

abstract = {Transactional memory (TM) promises to simplify concurrent programming while providing scalability competitive to fine-grained locking. Language-based constructs allow programmers to denote atomic regions declaratively and to rely on the underlying system to provide transactional guarantees along with concurrency. In contrast with fine-grained locking, TM allows programmers to write simpler programs that are composable and deadlock-free.TM implementations operate by tracking loads and stores to memory and by detecting concurrent conflicting accesses by different transactions. By automating this process, they greatly reduce the programmer's burden, but they also are forced to be conservative. Incertain cases, conflicting memory accesses may not actually violate the higher-level semantics of a program, and a programmer may wish to allow seemingly conflicting transactions to execute concurrently.Open nested transactions enable expert programmers to differentiate between physical conflicts, at the level of memory, and logical conflicts that actually violate application semantics. A TMsystem with open nesting can permit physical conflicts that are not logical conflicts, and thus increase concurrency among application threads.Here we present an implementation of open nested transactions in a Java-based software transactional memory (STM)system. We describe new language constructs to support open nesting in Java, and we discuss new abstract locking mechanisms that a programmer can use to prevent logical conflicts. We demonstrate how these constructs can be mapped efficiently to existing STM data structures. Finally, we evaluate our system on a set of Java applications and data structures, demonstrating how open nesting can enhance application scalability.},

By focusing on transactional access to a well-defined set of data structure operations, we strike a balance between the ease-of-programming of transactions and the efficiency of custom-tailored data structures. We exemplify this concept by designing and implementing a library supporting transactions on any number of maps, sets (implemented as skiplists), and queues. Our library offers efficient and scalable transactions, which are an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art transactional memory toolkits. Moreover, our approach treats stand-alone data structure operations (like put and enqueue) as first class citizens, and allows them to execute with virtually no overhead, at the speed of the original data structure library.},

A conventional STM tracks read- and write-sets of memory words; even simple operations can generate large sets. Our STM, which we call STO, tracks abstract operations on transactional datatypes instead. Parts of the transactional commit protocol are delegated to these datatypes' implementations, which can use datatype semantics, and new commit protocol features, to reduce bookkeeping, limit false conflicts, and implement efficient concurrency control. We test these ideas on the STAMP benchmark suite for STM applications and on our own prior work, the Silo high-performance in-memory database, observing large performance improvements in both systems.},

abstract="Transactional data structures with the same performance of highly concurrent data structures enable performance-competitive transactional applications. Although Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a promising technology for designing and implementing transactional applications, STM-based transactional data structures still perform inferior to their optimized, concurrent (i.e. non-transactional) counterparts. In this paper, we present OTB-Set, an efficient optimistic transactional lazy set based on both linked-list and skip-list implementations. We first provide general guidelines to show how to design a transactional (non-optimized) version of the highly concurrent lazy set with a minimal reengineering effort. Subsequently, we show how to make specific optimizations to the implementations of the OTB-Set for further enhancing its performance. We also prove that our OTB-Set provides linearizable individual operations and opaque transactions. Our experimental study on a 64-core machine reveals that OTB-Set outperforms competitors in most workloads.",

Software transactional memory (STM) provides a convenient and powerful programming model for composing atomic operations, but concurrent collection algorithms that allow their operations to be composed using STM are significantly slower than their non-composable alternatives.We introduce transactional predication, a method for building transactional maps and sets on top of an underlying non-composable concurrent map. We factor the work of most collection operations into two parts: a portion that does not need atomicity or isolation, and a single transactional memory access. The result approximates semantic conflict detection using the STM's structural conflict detection mechanism. The separation also allows extra optimizations when the collection is used outside a transaction. We perform an experimental evaluation that shows that predication has better performance than existing transactional collection algorithms across a range of workloads.},

We present an automated approach to concurrency control that addresses a common need: the need to atomically execute a code fragment, which may contain multiple ADT operations on multiple ADT instances. We present a synthesis algorithm that automatically enforces atomicity of given code fragments (in a client program) by inserting pessimistic synchronization that guarantees atomicity and deadlock-freedom (without using any rollback mechanism). Our algorithm takes a commutativity specification as an extra input. This specification indicates for every pair of ADT operations the conditions under which the operations commute. Our algorithm enables greater parallelism by permitting commuting operations to execute concurrently. We have implemented the synthesis algorithm in a Java compiler and applied it to several Java programs. Our results show that our approach produces efficient and scalable synchronization.},

abstract = {This paper introduces nonblocking transaction composition (NBTC), a new methodology for atomic composition of nonblocking operations on concurrent data structures. Unlike previous software transactional memory (STM) approaches, NBTC leverages the linearizability of existing nonblocking structures, reducing the number of memory accesses that must be executed together, atomically, to only one per operation in most cases (these are typically the linearizing instructions of the constituent operations).Our obstruction-free implementation of NBTC, which we call Medley, makes it easy to transform most nonblocking data structures into transactional counterparts while preserving their liveness and high concurrency. In our experiments, Medley outperforms Lock-Free Transactional Transform (LFTT), the fastest prior competing methodology, by 40--170\%. The marginal overhead of Medley's transactional composition, relative to separate operations performed in succession, is roughly 2.2x.For persistent data structures, we observe that failure atomicity for transactions can be achieved "almost for free'' with epoch-based periodic persistence. Toward that end, we integrate Medley with nbMontage, a general system for periodically persistent data structures. The resulting txMontage provides ACID transactions and achieves throughput up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the OneFile persistent STM system.},

abstract = {Nonblocking data structures allow scalable and thread-safe access to shared data. They provide individual operations that appear to execute atomically. However, it is often desirable to execute multiple operations atomically in a transactional manner. Previous solutions, such as Software Transactional Memory (STM) and transactional boosting, manage transaction synchronization separately from the underlying data structure’s thread synchronization. Although this reduces programming effort, it leads to overhead associated with additional synchronization and the need to rollback aborted transactions. In this work, we present a new methodology for transforming high-performance lock-free linked data structures into high-performance lock-free transactional linked data structures without revamping the data structures’ original synchronization design. Our approach leverages the semantic knowledge of the data structure to eliminate the overhead of false conflicts and rollbacks. We encapsulate all operations, operands, and transaction status in a transaction descriptor, which is shared among the nodes accessed by the same transaction. We coordinate threads to help finish the remaining operations of delayed transactions based on their transaction descriptors. When a transaction fails, we recover the correct abstract state by reversely interpreting the logical status of a node. We also present an obstruction-free version of our algorithm that can be applied to dynamic execution scenarios and an example of our approach applied to a hash map. In our experimental evaluation using transactions with randomly generated operations, our lock-free transactional data structures outperform the transactional boosted ones by 70\% on average. They also outperform the alternative STM-based approaches by a factor of 2 to 13 across all scenarios. More importantly, we achieve 4,700 to 915,000 times fewer spurious aborts than the alternatives.},

    abstract = { Breadth-first Search (BFS) is one of the most important graph processing subroutines, especially for computing the unweighted distance. Many applications may require running BFS from multiple sources. Sequentially, when running BFS on a cluster of nearby vertices, a known optimization is using bit-parallelism. Given a subset of vertices of size \(k\) and the distance between any pair of them is no more than \(d\), BFS can be applied to all of them in a total work of \(O(dm(k/w+1))\), where \(w\) is the length of a word in bits and \(m\) is the number of edges. We will refer to this approach as cluster-BFS (C-BFS). Such an approach has been studied and shown effective both in theory and in practice in the sequential setting. However, it remains unknown how this can be combined with thread-level parallelism. In this paper, we focus on designing efficient parallel C-BFS based on BFS to answer unweighted distance queries. Our solution combines the strengths of bit-level parallelism and thread-level parallelism, and achieves significant speedup over the plain sequential solution. We also apply our algorithm to real-world applications. In particular, we identified another application (landmark-labeling for the approximate distance oracle) that can take advantage of parallel C-BFS. Under the same memory budget, our new solution improves accuracy and/or time on all the 18 tested graphs.
